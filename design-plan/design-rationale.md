Design Rationale:

For this design I tried to focus on the common web practices and trends with some changes to suit this type of website specifically. Here the goal is to connect a community and to do that effectively the user needs to efficiently filter and find the events that they want to attend. To do this I felt it was meaningful to add a few features such as the search, filtering, and the concise information on the cards. To take care of the users who want to search for a specific type of event, the search bar being at the top makes sense, then the filtering being below to catch those who may want a more catered selection but may not have the knowledge of what to search. The cards get right to business and are vertically stacked with information, the image then title and subtitle below. I decided to put more of the information inside the card to make the user get into teh card and make the decision with all of the information instead of giving them more information at the start with no buttons that can get users to push the bounds more with how they consider going to events.
